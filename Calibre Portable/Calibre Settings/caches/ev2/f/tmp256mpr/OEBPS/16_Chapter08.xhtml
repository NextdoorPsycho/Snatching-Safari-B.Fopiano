Unless a certain input level is reached, the trigger will not open. As with a compressor, a noise gate includes features such as threshold, attack, and release. It may include a ‘hold’ setting, which tells the unit how long to wait before the release, and a ‘duck’ setting, which activates the sidechain. Noise gates, like compressors, are commonly placed within the chain of a signal track and not across a send, as a reverb would be.
