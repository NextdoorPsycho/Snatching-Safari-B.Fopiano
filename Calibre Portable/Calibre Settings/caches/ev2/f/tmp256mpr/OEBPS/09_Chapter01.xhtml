Recording music is so much easier if you understand music. Music plays a key role in the vast majority of recordings so most clients prefer ‘musical’ engineers. If you don't play an instrument, buy a guitar or keyboard and learn some basic songs.

There's no reason to broadcast to everyone that you are manipulating an instrument or vocal sound. Just quietly do it and, if they ask, tell them any changes are minor.

The confident engineer says, ‘This is the sound we want; let's record it,’ rather than, ‘Hey, how's this?’ Unless someone really doesn't like the sound, everyone should go along.
